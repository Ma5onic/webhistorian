# Web Historian - a Google Chrome extension for visualizing the web browsing history that already exists on your browser
This extension for the Google Chrome browser lets you visualize your web browsing history in ways you've never seen before. See how you navigate the web, what search words you use the most, and what websites you visit using interactive visualizations.

The goal of the Web Historian project is to facilitate mixed methods social science research. Most research about the web either uses records of actual browsing behavior or asks questions about web browsing (through surveys or interviews). When a project does both it is usually a lab experiment, which can answer some research questions but not others.

Web Historian helps users analyze their own web browsing, and if they consent they can share their observations and provide context for their web browsing records. This allows social scientists to combine the analysis of real-world browsing records with the contextual information that can only be provided by the users themselves. 

The extension uses the D3.js for the visualizations and accesses the history data via the chrome.history API.

Web Historian runs entirely on the local browser using only client-side JavaScript.
