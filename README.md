# Web Historian: See your web browsing history in a new light
This extension for the Google Chrome browser lets you visualize your web browsing history in ways you've never seen before. See how you navigate the web, what search words you use the most, and what websites you visit using interactive visualizations.

Web Historian helps users analyze their own web browsing, and users can opt-in to donate their history data to a research project and take a brief survey to provide context for the data. This allows social scientists to combine the analysis of real-world browsing records with the contextual information that can only be provided by the users themselves. 

The extension uses the D3.js for the visualizations and accesses the history data via the chrome.history API.

Web Historian runs entirely on the local browser using only client-side JavaScript and can be used while the browser offline, until the "participate" option is chosen.
