# Web Historian - a Google Chrome extension
This extension for the Google Chrome browser lets you visualize your web browsing history in ways you've never seen before. See how you navigate the web, what search words you use the most, and what websites you visit using interactive visualizations.

The extension uses the D3.js for the visualizations and accesses the history data via the chrome.history API.
